# Data-Structures-for-Efficient-Storage-of-Vehicle-Locations
Vehicle hiring companies such as Uber, rely on fast localization of available vehicles near potential
customers. Such efficient localization requires specialized data structures, and the goal of this project is to implement
and use one such data structure.

Vehicles and customers are localized using GPS devices available in mobile phones, and these devices determine
the longitude and latitude coordinates as floating-point numbers. To simplify the task, however, the
geographical area under consideration will be divided into small cells and integers will be used to identify each location on the map.
